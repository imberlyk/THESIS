        In defense of the Poor QR code <br>


QR Codes today are often met with a mix of disdain or indifference. Their utility post-pandemic is undeniable, woven into everyday interactions, yet in design circles, they’re typically seen as a necessary evil. In defense of the Poor QR code aims to reveal the hidden potential behind a genius technology.  For once the QR Code takes center stage, advocating for its place at the forefront rather than an afterthought, shoved aside next to the logo that the designer managed to keep small. 
For me, QR Codes are powerful tools and rare portals to the unfiltered, “good old web.” They reconnect us to an internet beyond app-based confines. QR Codes could be a tool to decentralize the internet and our web experiences. But this potential comes with a clear condition: they must be mobile-first.
In this publication, each of these mobile-first micro-websites serves as a small experiment, playfully testing the limits of design and functionality within the QR code’s framework.

    <p class="ABSTEXT">The weird Absurd Web <br> Is  a mix of essays, visuals and QR Code extensions. The book explores themes of absurdism, web explorations and rebellions against curated sameness. Each QR code invites readers to step off algorithms and into tethered hyperlinked digital spaces, which often are small spaces that surprise,disrupt and celebrate the “weird”. I make the case for and try to resist nostalgia while pushing for  reclaiming the hyperlink as a tool for discovery, embracing mobile-first design, reintroducing the web as a playground for 
        the strange and unexpected.
