    <p class="ABSTEXT">​​I enjoy patterns, humor and a sense of naivete that some might just deem stupid. But I think it’s important to understand that the internet is an inherently absurdist space. Starting from how we see the internet to how we interact with it, to how we don’t even understand how it actually works. While we often associate the internet with portals (after all, we once called websites “Internet Portals” (in German at least), I feel wormholes more accurately capture the experience. Portals promise instant connection. But what do we do when these connections get disturbed, when the desired outcome does not transpire? 

        Wormholes imply a journey, one that allows for straying off the intended path, creating potential for divergence and exploration. They exist as theory, fantasy, or proposition, an imagined space where paths are not always linear and realities alter. Much like the internet, wormholes are about the “in-between,” the transitional. This feels rhizomatic, a non-hierarchical web of connections that extends in multiple directions. 
        
        We enter and exit spaces on the daily, in constant motion, always interconnected. My work investigates these themes through visual and digital projects, blending physical and digital elements to reflect the tension between reality and representation. In doing so, I seek to create accessible, fun, and thought-provoking experiences that invite audiences to navigate the absurdity and complexity of these transitional spaces in a playful way, as sometimes, I would argue that it feels more beneficial to lean into the delusional and hedonistic as a form of coping.
